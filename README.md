## How do I know if this quiz is for me?
Well, most likely yes, but here's who I had in mind when I created this quiz:
Millinial ladies who like to joke around with their friends and take funny quizes during their lunch break (because these ladies are taking charge of their financials & bring home the bacon).

If you don't identify yourself as a perky, clever young lady, no worries, I still think you could find this quiz amusing.


## So, what can I expect?
- A fully responsive design (because let's be honest, we're always on our phones)
- Fonts & a fun color pallet to make you purr
- 5 interesting questions followed by your quiz results
- An occasional kitty appearence


## How do I actually take the quiz?
Great question- all you have to do is click the url located at the top of the page (it should be in blue). Click on that & you are all set!

## If you are interested in the nitty gritty... 

To develop this quiz I used the holy grail - HTML, CSS, & Javascript

## The process...

- Where it all began. Wireframing 

## Originally.. (bronze)
When I first created this quiz, it was pretty basic. All of the content was displayed on the page at the same time. The color pallet was super boooring - white, black, & a touch of grey. The buttons were static. The font was.. readable. The results displayed under all of the content that was already on the page. It worked, which was beautiful in it's own sense, but I knew I could do better for my furry friends. 

## Then (silver)
So once I was able to get the quiz working, I spruced things up a little bit (functionality wise). With the help of Esin Saribudak & Jennifer Meade, we were able to map out the logic to have one question appear at a time with the incorporation of a 'next' button. Additionallly I was able to add a welcome page, start button, and results page. Things were starting to look pretty legit at that point! But I knew I could do better for my users & I needed to 'prettify' the quiz. So I decided on a color scheme, chose a google font pairing, and slaped together a few graphic elements. But this wasn't the end.

## Finally (goldish..gold leafed?)
By this point, the quiz was functioning & starting to look like an actual, legitimite quiz! Yay! But I knew I could spice it up even more. To do this I really dialed in on my CSS, making sure the designs were sleek throughout the entire quiz by utilizing media querries & all sorts of other CSS properties (think margin, padding, alignment, positioning, letter spacing.. all the things). I also sourced images for all of my katz and javascripted an image to appear with the results page by using my event listeners already in place. Lastly, I incorporated cat illustrations that I found online (<a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/icon">Icon vector created by terdpongvector - www.freepik.com</a>) by Terdpongvector (yep, doesn't get much more professional than that) for the cherry on top!
